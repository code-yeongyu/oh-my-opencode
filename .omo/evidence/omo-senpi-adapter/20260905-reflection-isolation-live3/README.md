# Reflection isolation QA

## What was tested

`bun packages/omo-senpi/scripts/qa/memory-reflection-isolation-e2e.mjs --evidence-slug 20260905-reflection-isolation-live3`

Real worktree-local Senpi PTY; built local OMO extension; localhost scripted model.

## What was observed

PASS; see result.json, terminal raw files, model-requests.jsonl, sessions, reflection-run, receipts and completions.

## Why it is enough

Completion and merged files, child argv and actual HTTP system prompts, fresh-session health counts, isolation snapshots and cleanup receipts are independent PASS gates. Health failures are synthetic durable fixtures, not simulated delivery hooks.

## What was omitted

No production credentials, auth files, real-home file contents or environment dumps are copied. No claim about live model quality.
